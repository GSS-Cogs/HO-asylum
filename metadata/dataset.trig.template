        dct:description      "Figures shown in as_01 for 1989 to 1993  and as_02 for 1989 to 2001 were rounded to the nearest 5 (- = 0, * = 1 or 2) and may not sum to the totals shown because of independent rounding. Figures for applications shown in as_02 for 1991 to 2001 are rounded to the nearest 100 due to dependants applications being estimated. Data, after April 2000 for asylum applications and May 2000 for asylum decisions, have been taken from the Asylum Case Information Database. Prior to this date manual counts were taken. The tables do not include grants of asylum or ELR (exceptional leave to remain) or refusals on non-compliance grounds under the backlog criteria in 1999 and 2000 which aimed to reduce the pre-1996 asylum application backlog. In as_01 'Fresh claims' are when a human rights or asylum claim has been refused, withdrawn or treated as withdrawn under paragraph 333C of Immigration Rule 353 and any appeal relating to that claim is no longer pending, the decision maker will consider any further submissions and, if rejected, will then determine whether they amount to a fresh claim. The submissions will amount to a fresh claim if they are significantly different from the material that has previously been considered. The submissions will only be significantly different if the content: had not already been considered; and taken together with the previously considered material, created a realistic prospect of success, not withstanding its rejection. 'Pending' cases are those asylum applications, including fresh claims, lodged since 1 April 2006 which are still under consideration at the end of the reference period."@en ;

The data exclude unaccompanied asylum seeking children supported by Local Authorities. The data on asylum seekers in dispersed accommodation exclude those in initial accommodation. 'Disbenefited cases' are cases that were supported under the main UK benefits system and were moved into asylum support. Some of these cases remained in the original social services accommodation while still supported. Since Q2 2010, data on disbenefited cases have not been published. See below for changes to Local Authorities. Caution should be taken when comparing data for 2012 and earlier with figures from 2013 onwards, due to a change in processing method."@en;

From 3 July 2017, all arrivals under these schemes were granted refugee status. The Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme was launched in January 2014 and the first arrivals came in March 2014. The figures do not include those resettled to the UK under the ex gratia scheme for Afghan locally engaged civilians. Figures presented here relate to the local authority people are allocated to under the Vulnerable Persons Resettlement (VPR) scheme, as recorded on Home Office databases at the time the data were extracted on 10th July 2017. To aid the operation of the VPR scheme, people are allocated to a lead local authority in advance of resettlement and will be recorded on the database as such. However, on arrival in the UK, some may actually be resettled in a different local authority to that originally recorded (generally one that neighbours the lead authority) and the database will be updated to reflect this. These revisions will be incorporated into the data series on an annual basis in line with Home Office statistics revision policy, as set out in the statement of compliance with the code of practice for official statistics: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/statement-of-compliance-with-code-of-practice-for-official-statistics."@en;

A 'take charge' requests relate to the premise that a first application has been lodged, so the responsible Dublin State is to be determined in accordance with the criteria in the Dublin III amendment. A 'take back' request involves cases where the applicant has lodged an application in one Dublin State and has moved on to another Dublin State where he or she has lodged a further application or is present illegally, without making a further application. The notion of â€˜take backâ€™ implies that an applicant has previously been known as an asylum applicant in another Dublin State and so his or her application can be â€˜taken backâ€™ into the asylum system there. The criteria for determining the Member State responsible for examining the asylum claim, along with further details on the Dublin regulation, are set out in the user guide."@en;
